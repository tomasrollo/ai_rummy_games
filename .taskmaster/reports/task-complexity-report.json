			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI Interface Skeleton",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement CLI Interface Skeleton' task into 5 detailed subtasks, covering (1) environment and dependency setup, (2) Typer app initialization, (3) Rich console integration, (4) stub functions for user input and output, and (5) writing basic smoke tests.",
			"reasoning": "This is a medium‐complexity setup with well-defined library use and clear stubbed behavior; it benefits from a handful of concrete implementation steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Game Setup Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Game Setup Logic' task into 6 detailed subtasks, including prompting for player count, collecting names, initializing and shuffling the deck, dealing cards, setting up draw/discard piles, and selecting the starting player.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple sequential operations and state transitions must be orchestrated, requiring clear division into specific setup steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Turn and Round Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement Turn and Round Management' task into 5 subtasks: main game loop structure, draw phase logic, display and discard phase, round-counter increment logic, and menu option gating for early rounds.",
			"reasoning": "Core game-loop logic with stateful phases and conditional behavior across rounds is moderately complex and needs clear, isolated implementations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Initial Declaration Validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the 'Implement Initial Declaration Validation' task into 5 subtasks: define Validator class, implement point-value calculations, detect pure sequences without jokers, integrate validation into GameState, and write comprehensive unit tests.",
			"reasoning": "Requires algorithmic checks (point sums, sequence detection) and integration into game state – a complex validation scenario that needs careful breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Meld and Extension Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Implement Meld and Extension Logic' task into 4 subtasks: extend Validator for new meld rules, extend Validator for table extensions, integrate CLI commands for declare/extend, and create unit tests for each rule branch.",
			"reasoning": "Building on validation logic with additional rule branches; moderately complex but focused on extensions of existing validation patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Game Closure and Scoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Game Closure and Scoring' task into 5 subtasks: detect game-end condition, calculate scores for declarer and non-declarers, handle joker scoring rules, update GameState for closure, and render scoreboard with Rich.",
			"reasoning": "Scoring involves multiple conditional calculations and state updates; clear separation of detection, calculation, and output simplifies the implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Write Automated Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the 'Write Automated Test Suite' task into 4 subtasks: set up test directory and fixtures, write unit tests for core modules, implement integration tests for full gameplay flows, and configure CI test runner.",
			"reasoning": "Testing is essential but follows a standard structure; breaking it into environment setup, unit, integration, and CI ensures coverage and automation."
