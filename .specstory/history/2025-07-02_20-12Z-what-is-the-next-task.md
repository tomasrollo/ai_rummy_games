What is the next task?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you find the next task. First, let me check if there's a Task Master project initialized in your workspace and see what tasks are available. Great! I can see there's a `` directory, which suggests Task Master is already initialized. Let me check the next task for you. The next task is **Task #1: Setup Project Repository**.

**Description:** Initialize the Python project using uv, configure project structure and install required dependencies.

**Details:**
- Create Git repository
- Initialize uv with `uv init`
- Add dependencies to pyproject.toml with `uv add`: `rich`
- Create directory structure: tests/, docs/

**Test Strategy:** Verify that pyproject.toml exists with correct dependencies; confirm project structure files and directories

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending  
**Dependencies:** None

This is the first task in your AI Rummy Games project and involves setting up the basic project infrastructure. When you're ready to start working on it, you can set the status to "in-progress" and begin with the setup steps outlined in the task details.
