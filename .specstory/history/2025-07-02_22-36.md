What is the next task?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you find the next task. First, let me check if there's a Task Master project initialized in your workspace and see what tasks are available. Great! I can see there's a `` directory, which suggests Task Master is already initialized. Let me check the next task for you. The next task is **Task #1: Setup Project Repository**.

**Description:** Initialize the Python project using uv, configure project structure and install required dependencies.

**Details:**
- Create Git repository
- Initialize uv with `uv init`
- Add dependencies to pyproject.toml with `uv add`: `rich`
- Create directory structure: tests/, docs/

**Test Strategy:** Verify that pyproject.toml exists with correct dependencies; confirm project structure files and directories

**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Pending  
**Dependencies:** None

This is the first task in your AI Rummy Games project and involves setting up the basic project infrastructure. When you're ready to start working on it, you can set the status to "in-progress" and begin with the setup steps outlined in the task details.

I'll help you proceed with the first task: "Setup Project Repository". Let me start by setting the task status to "in-progress" and then work through the setup steps. Great! Now let me work through the setup steps. First, let me check the current state of the project: I can see that Git is already initialized (`` directory exists). Now let me initialize the project with uv: Great! Now let me add the `rich` dependency: Excellent! Now let me create the required directory structure (tests/ and docs/): Now let me verify that everything was set up correctly by checking the project structure and the `pyproject.toml` file: Perfect! Let me check the `pyproject.toml` to verify the dependencies: Excellent! Now let me update the task status to completed and add a summary of what was accomplished: Perfect! **Task #1: Setup Project Repository** has been completed successfully! 

## Summary of what was accomplished:

✅ **Git repository** - Already existed  
✅ **uv initialization** - Project initialized with `uv init`  
✅ **Dependencies** - Added `rich>=14.0.0` to `pyproject.toml`  
✅ **Directory structure** - Created `` and `` directories  
✅ **Verification** - Confirmed `pyproject.toml` exists with correct dependencies and project structure

The project now has:
- A proper Python project structure with uv
- Virtual environment (``)
- Rich library for enhanced terminal output
- Test and documentation directories
- Dependency management via `pyproject.toml`

## Next Task Available:
**Task #2: Implement Card and Deck Models** - This will involve creating the core Card and Deck classes that support two decks plus jokers, with shuffling, drawing, and discarding functionality.

Would you like to proceed with the next task, or would you like to review anything about the current setup?

I'll proceed with Task #2: "Implement Card and Deck Models". Let me start by setting the task status to "in-progress" and then implement the Card and Deck classes. Now let me check the current project structure to understand where to place the code: Perfect! I'll create a proper package structure. Let me create the models module with Card and Deck classes: Now I'll create the models module with Card and Deck classes: Now let me create comprehensive pytest unit tests as specified in the task: I need to add pytest as a development dependency. Let me do that: Perfect! Now let me create an `__init__.py` file for the tests directory: Now let me run the tests to verify everything works correctly: Excellent! All tests are passing. Let me also run a quick verification to ensure the deck has exactly 108 cards as specified: Perfect! The implementation is working correctly. Now let me update the `main.py` to demonstrate the functionality: 
```

```
Let me test the main application: Excellent! Now let me mark the task as completed: Perfect! **Task #2: Implement Card and Deck Models** has been completed successfully! 

## Summary of what was accomplished:

✅ **Card dataclass** - Created with suit, rank, and is_joker flag  
✅ **Deck class** - Builds 108 cards: two standard decks (104 cards) + 4 jokers  
✅ **Shuffle functionality** - Implemented using `random.shuffle`  
✅ **Draw method** - Pops from draw_pile and returns Card  
✅ **Discard method** - Pushes cards to discard_pile  
✅ **Separate piles** - Maintains draw_pile and discard_pile lists  
✅ **Comprehensive tests** - 13 pytest unit tests covering all functionality  
✅ **Verification** - All tests pass and deck composition is correct  

## Key Features Implemented:

- **Card class**: Full string representation, joker support, proper dataclass structure
- **Deck class**: Exact 108-card composition (52×2 + 4 jokers), shuffling, drawing, discarding
- **Additional utilities**: Card counting, peek functionality, empty pile handling
- **Rich demo**: Beautiful terminal output showing the functionality
- **Full test coverage**: Tests verify deck size, shuffle behavior, draw/discard operations

## Next Task Available:
**Task #3: Implement Player and GameState Models** - This will create the Player and GameState classes to track players, hands, turn state, melds, and game progression.

The foundation is now solid with a properly working card and deck system. Would you like to proceed with the next task?

Let's expand the task #3 first to subtasks

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll expand Task #3 into subtasks to break down the implementation of Player and GameState Models into more manageable pieces. Perfect! Task #3 has been expanded into 5 well-structured subtasks. Here's what we now have:

## Task #3: Implement Player and GameState Models
**Status:** Pending | **Subtasks:** 5

### Subtask 3.1: Implement Player Model
- Create Player class with name, hand, and declaration status
- Add methods for managing cards and declaration
- **Dependencies:** None

### Subtask 3.2: Implement Meld Model  
- Create Meld class for sequences and sets
- Implement validation logic for meld integrity
- **Dependencies:** None

### Subtask 3.3: Implement GameState Model
- Create GameState class to track game progression
- Include players, piles, melds, round, and turn management
- **Dependencies:** Subtasks 3.1, 3.2

### Subtask 3.4: Add Serialization/Deserialization
- Implement to_dict() and from_dict() methods for debugging
- Support JSON serialization for all models
- **Dependencies:** Subtasks 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

### Subtask 3.5: Write Comprehensive Unit Tests
- Create end-to-end test coverage
- Include edge cases and validation scenarios
- **Dependencies:** All previous subtasks

The subtasks are now organized with clear dependencies and can be worked on systematically. Each subtask has specific implementation details and test strategies defined.

Would you like to proceed with working on these subtasks, starting with Subtask 3.1 (Implement Player Model)?

Please proceed on task 3

_**Assistant**_

I'll proceed with Task #3 by working through the subtasks systematically. Let me start with Subtask 3.1: Implement Player Model. Now let me start with Subtask 3.1 - implementing the Player Model. First, let me check the current models.py file to see what's already there: Let me read the rest of the file: Now I'll add the Player, Meld, and GameState models to the existing `models.py` file. Let me start by implementing all the required models: 
````

````
Now I need to add the serialization methods to the Card class as well: 
````

````
Now let me check if there are any import issues and fix the imports at the top: Good, the imports are correct. Now let me create comprehensive unit tests for all the new models: Let me add comprehensive tests for the new models by appending to the existing test file: 
````

````
Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works correctly: Excellent! All 41 tests are passing. Now let me update the `main.py` file to demonstrate the new functionality: 
```

```
Let me test the updated main application: Perfect! Now let me mark all the subtasks as completed and then mark the main task as done: Now let me mark the main task as completed: Perfect! **Task #3: Implement Player and GameState Models** has been completed successfully!
